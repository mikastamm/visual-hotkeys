# Visual Hotkeys
Use your Keyboard to browse the Web!
</center>
<hr>
The web has too few keyboard shortcuts! This extension adds a few more. It aims to add keyboard shortcuts to the most common actions on each website, and to make it clear what actions can be triggered by hotkeys.

## Features
- [x] Hotkeys (0-9) for the Search Results on DuckDuckGo and Google
- [x] Hold the alt key to open search results in a new tab
- [x] Define custom hotkeys for any website using JSON & xpath

## Plans
- [ ] Add unified hotkeys for common action-concepts across multiple pages (Site-Home, Preferences, Next-Item etc.)
- [ ] Make it easy for users to add their own hotkeys
- [ ] Let people share their hotkeys and create a community curated set of useful hotkeys for many pages
